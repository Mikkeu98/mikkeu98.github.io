        <h3>brockhampton Flyer</h3>
        <p>For one of my design classes I had to make concert posters. I decided to make two for an upcoming Brockhampton concert.<br><br> Brockhampton has a distinct look to their merchandise and posters that I wanted to recreated in my poster. Their original mixtape cover was a poorly cut together collage of pictures of each of the members.<img src="images/bhproto1.jpg" alt="poster sketch"  class="brockhampton"> The logo was made in the same style as the font they use in their music videos which is very recognizable to fans of this group. I used illustrator to achieve this gradation of the font color.<br><br> I wanted it to see kind of old or wrinkled as they have a very alternative type of look so I used old paper filters over the whole piece. <br><br>I used filters and different modes in photoshop to distort the images more and make the cut out look more noticeable.
On the right is a rough draft of the poster. <br><br>I made the name of the group so small and was still messing with layer modes. I added more information and change some of the layout around because it didn’t flow properly to my eyes.

 I had another poster idea that I eventually dropped. This one followed the style of Brockhampton’s official posters less than the other poster I created. <br><br>It has the font similar to the title songs of Brockhamton. This poster used more cut out paper elements to give a collage-like feel to it. I used an old paper texture to give it a worn out look.<br><br> On the main image, I used multiple filters and layer modes on it to make it the focal point of the poster as it is an image of most of the members. <br><br>I left many imperfections in the poster since their own posters and not usually perfect looking either.
