      <h2>Roboto Typeface Research</h2>
      <h4>26 April 2018</h4>
      <p>Roboto was designed by Christian Robertson. Robertson is an interface designer for Google. It was released in 2011 but redesigned in 2014. It is in the category of Sans-Serif and classified as Neo-grotesque.It is the standard font for phones operating
        on Android. It is mainly used for smaller text or body text. </p>
      <p>Roboto is being used on websites like https://info-buddhism.com , https://medium.com , and http://www.dosed.co.uk . It is also used in packaging, like in BLK water, and posters, brochures, and books.</p>
      <p>Yes, the font is used properly. It is being used for the body text and other information. It is used for more important details besides the title or header. The font is very easy to read, is has good legibility. The spacing on the letters is also
        not very big so the readability isnâ€™t that bad either. I like the roundness of the letters and that it is sans-serif. </p>
      <p>Google describes it as a modern font yet has feeling to it. It is a clean and friendly font. It is used in websites for more young people like Instagram.</p>
