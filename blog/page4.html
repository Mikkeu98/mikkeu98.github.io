      <h2>Mobile First</h2>
      <h4>
  May 10 2018</h4>

      <p> The first mobile sites I looked at were twitter.com, tumblr.com, and amazon.com. I use these three sites very often on my phone. All have app versions for their phone but you can also access them from the web browser on your phone. </p>
      <p> Twitter is a scrolling social media website. I use it to talk to my friends and find interesting posts on the site. Both on the computer and the phone you have to scroll to see new posts. Both can be refreshed and new posts will appear. The difference
        is the space given to posts, since the phone screen is smaller it has to dedicate more space to the posts, the main reason you are on this site. On the desktop version there are sidebars on both sides of you feed. If the phone version was the
        exact same as the desktop then you would have trouble seeing the posts and would have to zoom in all the time.</p>
      <p>Tumblr is another scrolling website. Using the site with a web browser on your phone is a bit more difficult since they encourage you to use their app instead. Still the app and browser versions are fairly similar. Like the twitter mobile site,
        most of the screen is dedicated to the posts. The additional features, like blog, activity, and settings, are pushed to the bottom navigation bar so you can switch away to those when you need to see them. The desktop site itself has a lot of empty
        space around the sidebar, navigation, and posts. These empty spaces help balance the design on the big screen but have no purpose on a mobile site.</p>
      <p> Amazon.com is a shopping website I use a lot for last minute supplies or things I just need very soon. I prefer using the phone to shop than the website because there is a lot less sidebars and objects all over the screen to distract me. All you
        really see when searching for an item is the search bar, the list of items matching your description, and the sidebar that is hidden that can be used to filter your selection. I believe there is too many navigation bars at the top of the amazon
        website and then huge drop down menus. I think if they simplified their website I would use it on the desktop more.</p>
