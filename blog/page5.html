      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <h4>
31 May 2018</h4>

      <p>I want the content to appeal to people my age. I want the design to not distract from the content. The focus should be on the content and the design and color palette should draw your eyes to the design.</p>

      <p>I like a more modern, abstract look usually. I look at places like pinterest for inspiration. I pin a few posts I really like and try to find similarities between them. Making mood boards and mashing together ideas I like helps create the design
        I want to make.</p>

      <p>I like sans-serif typefaces more for a more modern look. Type that is spaced far apart is also good. Type that might look like it is from a typewriter could be good as well since it can give a bit of a retro look. I prefer sans-serif however, because
        there is less frills with the letters. It feels more straightforward and impactful.
      </p>
      <p>The most important thing was about the color scheme not being cohesive enough. I decided to tone down some of the colors and make the background more desaturated. That way the banner and works would stand out more. I also removed the nav button
        at the top since it did not have a purpose. Also some tabs I had, also had no purpose so I altered them as well.</p>
