      <h2>“The Core Model: Designing Inside Out for Better Results” Response</h2>
      <h4>08 May 2018</h4>
      <p>According to the article “The Core Model: Designing Inside Out for Better Results” by Ida Aalen, the home page of the website might be the hardest part of a site to design. Homepages were confusing for clients and designers because of how it should
        be laid out, ot his play all the information or to by a huge navigation to the whole pagee.An information architect named Are Hallland helped solve the issue of home pages with the idea the core model. These models helped by showing what users
        needed to accomplish while on the page. That is the main goal of a homepage, to help the user accomplish what they came to do and to help achieve the message of the client. </p>
      <p>The tasks of a page are divided into what the business wants to accomplish and what the visitor does, there should be some overlap between the two. While not everything will be a business goal or not everything the business wants to display will
        be what the user came there for, you can easily find ways to add a navigation to this other part of the website. </p>
      <p>The core model is a thinking tool, like brainstorming. It helps the designers know what to information needs to be on the page and what parts should be emphasized. The article mentions the last page being made is usually the home page and I think
        that makes sense since a lot of the information for a home page, you need the other webpages first. </p>
      <p>The article also provides a very interactive why for stakeholders to get involved with the designing process. It gives a list of things needed for a core model workshop which sounds like a fun activity to do.</p>
