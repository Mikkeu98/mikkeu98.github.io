      <h2>What happens once all of our information has been collected?</h2>
      <h4>05 April 2018</h4>
      <p>According to Forbes.com, personal data is already being assessed for how much value it has in the economy. It has even been compared to oil as a valuable resource. Companies like Facebook or Uber have a lot of hidden value because of all the information
        they can collect about userâ€™s interests and where they go. So while you may be getting a free service or a cheap taxi-like service, you are paying additionally with data that can be used by other companies. </p>
      <p>There are many concerns because data has never been used in this way so frequently before. It is easy for companies to sell data to multiple other companies but there is nothing stopping other companies from selling that data too. It becomes harder
        to contain data to be used for only a certain purpose at that point. Articles from Forbes and The Economist talk about how there are new laws being discussed in Europe on how to regulate data collection and the use of personal data. </p>
      <p>I believe as more people become aware that their personal information is being sold to companies, the more we will demand laws to protect us. However, when we are using applications and services for free or very little cost that used to be very
        expensive, we have to be aware that these services may be collection or information to sell and make up the cost for their cheap price tag. Companies will be doing this more and more as personal information gains higher value and is sold for more
        and more money. </p>
      <p>This data allows for personal preferences to be known and companies can personalize what they sell to each person, maximizing their profit As use of personal data becomes more commonplace, we have to use laws to prevent this information from being
        used for discriminatory or surveillance purposes.</p>
