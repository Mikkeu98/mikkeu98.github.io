        <h3>Happiness</h3>
        <p>A spread from 	my zine. <br><br>Throughout this zine I use colors to show happiness and love moves. It moves from person to person or is created between people. In this spread it shows the feeling of happiness creeping up on you, you don’t realize it but you’re happy with life.<br><br> The place you are in today is where you wanted to be a some time ago. That’s the feeling I want to send with this.
<br><br><br>I created this spread with illustrator and photoshop. The colorful spill was made by distorting circles I previously made for other pages. I wanted them to look like they were melting.<br><br> I used the same circles because I wanted unity among the pages. The gradient background, text, and sparkle effect was made in photoshop.  				</p>
